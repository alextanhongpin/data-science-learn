Getting data is nice, but a data that is not actionable is not useful. Most of the time, we think of data as just some numbers to wow our stakeholders and presenting them measurable metrics (unless your sales is low etc), but those data can be valuable to your users too. 

- displaying number of users that are using the app gives user confidence on the app loyalty
- random facts such as what is purchased the most
- summary of some data
- related topics based on what the user like
- random tips on how to make better puchasing decision/what/when to buy something, or why is it good
- learn the user's fear through data (poor sales because unsure if the product is worth it) and how to conquer it/give confidence/provide support
