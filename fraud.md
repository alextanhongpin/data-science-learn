## Fraud Detection

Compare content between different files. Say we have a claims and we uploaded the file. And we have a user with the name, gender etc. We can check if the information in the file still matches, last date etc etc.

## Stream processing for real-time analysis

Is there a way of returning partial scoring (think streaming). Say, for fraud detection, we usually want to find if a transaction is a fraud, but it may take day etc. Can we return the confidence score partially, and request data at the same time to improve the final score? We can use this in job applications too. Say, every step that the employer performed will be notified to the user, from receiving the application, initial screening, feedbacks etc will be delivered step by step to the end user.
