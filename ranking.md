There are a lot of use cases for ranking. For example, when booking a taxi, we need to find a driver to dispatch, and we need to find the driver by certain criteria such as:

- is the driver available (not sending any driver)
- what is the driver's reputation/rating
- from this pool of available drivers, who has the least/most passengers
- how far is the driver from the destination
- how to ensure each driver got rewarded differently
- what is the frequency of the driver getting a passenger

It can also be considered bidding, where the drivers bid for the position (instead of us assigning, the driver can opt to pick the drivers, and if there are more, then only we perform the ranking).
It is similar to load balancing, with different criteria.
