## How to improve OCR performance?

- clean the images, blur unwanted pixels and sharpen the image back
- perform OCR
- scan each word and checks if it exists in the dictionary, else, it could be a typo/error at the OCR
- perform auto-correct/auto-suggest for the text
- for words that cannot be identified, send a ticket for manual intervention
