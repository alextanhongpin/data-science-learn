Why not combine psychology with personalized recommendation? 

- Create a user profile by indirectly letting users to "take the" Brigg Myers personality test. Since we need a constrained profile (results from the Brigg Myers test) to identify users, we can extend it to correlate to their behaviours
- Ask one question at a time, then use it back for recommendation/personalized content. Or we can use cloud words to ask users what kind of category they are interested in. This is the direct approach. The best way is to have a combination of both direct and indirect way of gathering data.
- Make use of the user interaction, such as search to find out what user intents are.

## Capture intents

There are two kind of activity that are performed by the user on an app/web. One is predetermined by us, through features. We provide user with features that we assume they want to use (take Facebook for example, News Feed, watching Video, creating Posts), but a User could have a particular reason to stay on the app instead (Messaging friends). 

- logging user activity based on features
- logging user intent based on what they search/click
- logging how user actually uses the features (the activities they produce)

## Measuring values

What is the most valuable feature of your application? How do we measure it?

This could be done by:
- logging the outcome of the feature (e.g. purchase made, or user show interests by clicking on the content)
- measuring the activity/churn (e.g. user stop halfway when making the purchase)

## Building user profile

Creating user profile from the behaviour (action) and their intent (what they actually want)

- `activity`, the list of activity that the user carried out, such as browsing, clicking on particular content etc.
- `active` state, determined through the last login date/interact with app date.
- intent. The reason why a user use the app, which feature they interact the most.

## Actionable action

Measuring all the metrics above is good, but what can we do with the metrics mentioned above? Can we recommend user a better offer, or provide premium users more discounts? Or can we perhaps separate the users into different niche and present them a different content?
