## Where to obtain data

Machine learning approach is `passive` - attempting to digest data from various sources to “assume” a user’s profile, when the user are not providing them. The `active` (albeit slightly more traditional way) is to ask user to fill them up themselves, e.g. user profile completion with progress, asking users to subscribe the type of products they would like to see, or allowing user to select the tags/keywords from a cloud word. A more passive way is to have mini surveys (popup in mobile) that ask a user a specific question (would you buy a travel insurance if you travel to xyz). For FA app, if they are agent for a particular insurance agent, probably we could feed them latest news on new products, offers etc that are faster than the insurer themselves can provide.
