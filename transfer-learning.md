## What is transfer learning?

- a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 
- e.g. knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
- e.g. balancing logic learned while riding a bicycle can be transferred to learn driving other two-wheeled vehicle.
- a model that is developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
- In transfer learning, we first train a base network on a base dataset and task, and then we repurpose the learned features, or transfer them, to a second target network to be trained on a target dataset and task. This process will tend to work if the features are general, meaning suitable to both base and target task, instead of specific to the base task.
- the form of transfer learning used in deep learning is called inductive transfer.
- reduce effort to build a model from scratch by using the fundamental logic or base algorithms within one domain and applying it to another.

How to use transfer learning? 
1. develop model approach. A model needs to be designed first.
2. pre-trained model approach
